# Gender-classifier-on-facial-image
Predicts an individual is male or female on the basis of his/her facial features.
## Course of action for project 
The project aimed to develop a py app which uses camera to localize face and predict its features. As of now it is aimed at gender prediction.
The project will have two main tasks primarily:
1. Develop a GUI.
2. Working on algorithm to implement face localisation.
3. Improving present classifier model.

## Milestones aachieved 
Skeleton of the app has been developed. Model has reached 90% accuracy milestone.

## Architecture
Transfer learning on resnet-32 pre-trained on Imagenet dataset.

## Data
Scraping images from "Google Images"
